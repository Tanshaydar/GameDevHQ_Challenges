# GameDevHQ Unity C# Challenges
This repository is the solutions to the Unity programming challenges at [https://filebase.gamedevhq.com/challenges/](https://filebase.gamedevhq.com/challenges/)

In order to access to all of the questions, you need to have an active subscription to [FileBase](https://filebase.gamedevhq.com/).

I've imported all of the questions into their respective folders. Most of the questions are overwriting exising files, so I've resolved that while creating this repository and throughout respective commit pushes.

However, in order to avoid any __infringements__, I've removed the questions from the scenes.

Therefore, this repository is only useful if you already have an active subscription to FileBase but got stuck at a question, or want to compare your own solution to mine.

## Remember! There is no only one true solution to a problem. There are almost always multiple solutions that take real world restrictions and use cases into consideration!
